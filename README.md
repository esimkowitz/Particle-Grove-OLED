# Particle-Grove-OLED
Particle IDE library for the Grove 0.96" 128x64 OLED Display. The display is controlled over I2C and is a black-and-white unit.

This library is Evan Simkowitz's Particle IDE port of Visweswara R's SeeedOLED library, adapted specifically for the Grove 0.96" 128x64 unit. The original library was written in 2011 for Seeed Technology Inc.
